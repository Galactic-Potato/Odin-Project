		<h1>Hello World!</h1> <!--h1 is the t-->
		<p> This will be the first paragraph on my webpage. In order to make multiple paragraphs within html,
			we must use the paragraph "p" element. </p>
		<p> This is now my second paragraph on my webpage. As you can see, this paragraph is on a 
			seperate line to indicate a new paragraph.</p>
		<h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
		<h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
		<h3>This is a heading 3</h3>
		<h4>This is a heading 4</h4>
		<h5>This is a heading 5</h5>
		<h6>This is a heading 6</h6>
		
		<strong> The "strong" element makes the text bold, as seen in this line </strong>
		<p>You can also use the "strong" element to <strong>bold text</strong> within a line.</p>
		
		<em>The "em"(which means emphasize) element allows you to apply italic to text</em>
		<p>You can also <em>italic</em> select words.</p>
		<p> You may run into the "b" and "i" tags. While these tags will bold and italic your text, they have no meaning
			to the browser. This is particularly important when considering website accesiblity. The browser will not 
			emphasize the "b" and "i" tags like it will "strong" and "em"
