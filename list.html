	<p>If you want to have a list of items where the order doesnâ€™t matter, like a shopping list of items that can be bought in any order, then you can use an unordered list.
	   Unordered lists are created using the "ul" element, and each item within the list is created using the list item element "li".</p>
	 
	<p>Each list item in an unordered list begins with a bullet point</p>
	<p>Example</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Item 1</li>
		<li>Item 2</li>
		<li>Item 3</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If you instead want to create a list of items where the order does matter, like step-by-step instructions for a recipe, or your top 10 favorite TV shows, then you can use an ordered list.
	   Ordered lists are created using the "ol" element. Each individual item in them is again created using the list item element "li". However, each list item in an ordered list begins with a number instead:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Item 1</li>
		<li>Item 2</li>
		<li>Item 3</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Ordered lists also have a unique attributes. These include "start" and "reversed".</p>
	<p>While many ordered lists start with the number 1, the "start" attrubute allows you to start the list at any number you want. in the following example we will start from the number 23</p>
	
	<ol start="23">
		<li>This item will start at the number 23</li>
		<li>24</li>
		<li>And finally, the number 25</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>For the attrubute "reversed" the numbers will be in decending order insted of acending</p>
	
	<ol reversed>
		<li>Countdown, 3</li>
		<li>2</li>
		<li>1</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Another attribute is "value". This will change the number associated with the list.</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Item 1</li>
		<li value="4">Item 4</li>
		<li>Item 5</li>
		<li>Item 6</li>
		<li value="10">Item 10</li>
		<li>Item 11</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>In that example, I changed the value of the second item to the number 4, and the value of the fifth item to the number 10.</p>
	
	<p>Description lists are also seen, but not as often as ordered and unordered lists. For discription lists you will use the "dl" instead of "li". 
	   The discription list requires two elements to function correctly, "dt", which is the team element, and "dd" which is the description element. </p>
	   
	<dl>
		<dt>study</dt>
		<dd>The devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject, especially by means of books</dd>
		<dt>design</dt>
		<dd>A plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings of a building, garment, or other object before it is built or made</dd>
		<dd>Purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an action, fact, or material object</dd>
		<dt>business</dt>
		<dt>work</dt>
		<dd>A person's regular occupation, profession, or trade</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<p>Nesting</p> 
	
		<ol>
			<li>Walk the dog</li>
			<li>Fold clothes</li>
			<li>
			Go to the store and buy:
				<ul>
				 <li>Milk</li>
				 <li>Dog food</li>
				 <li>Chicken</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li> Mow the grass</li>
		</ol>
